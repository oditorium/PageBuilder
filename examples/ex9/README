# Example 9 -- Processing Single-Sheet Data

## Usage

- run `convert` to convert the files
- run `serve` to serve the current directory
- run `clean` to remove generated files

## Description

This example shows how data can be post-processed and re-injected into the
page where it came from.

IMPORTANT: Any fields read from _DATA must be defined have default values in
the  template, not only so that the first calculation does not fall over,
but also that they are picked up at all. ONLY PARAMETERS THAT HAVE DEFAULT
VALUES WILL BE READ FROM THE _DATA.
