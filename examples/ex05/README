# Example 5 -- Multiple Section Templates

## Usage

- run `convert` to convert the files
- run `serve` to serve the current directory
- run `clean` to remove generated files


## Description

This example shows how to work with multiple templates. It is slightly
unnatural in the it provides two files:

(1) the file `_SECTIONTEMPLATE.html` that, by definition, is containing the
`default` template and that is  the only one we have used in the previous
examples

(2) the file `_SECTIONTEMPLATES.html` that contains the other templates,
notably the templates for the formats called `myformat1` and `myformat2`

Usually if multiple templates are used and the default template is to be
changed from the default default template then simply a section

    ===== SECTIONTYPE: default  =====

should be added to `_SECTIONTEMPLATES.html`
