// The _SETTINGS file is prepended to each file processed if
// headings or regular text is present in this file it will
// be removed (this allows using headings and text to
// structure the file).

// The purpose of the settings file is to store global  meta
// data as well as links. For meta data the general rule is
// that subsequent definitions overwrite prior ones, so the
// settings file can either hold data that is needed
// everywhere, or default values that can be overwritten in
// the respective files

// for a file using section templates, the default values
// of the respective fields should be added to the settings
// file in case they are missing in one of the files

This is text that will be removed


// Links are defined using the standard Markdown format.
// For example the below link will allow to link to google
// in any document doing [link to Google][google].
