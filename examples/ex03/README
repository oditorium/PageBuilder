# Example 3 -- Using a Section Template

## Usage

- run `convert` to convert the files
- run `serve` to serve the current directory
- run `clean` to remove generated files

## Description

This is an example for converting files into a a single html file: when
running the `convert` command,  the all files in the directory are converted
into a single file called  `document.html` (as will as into individual
files).

This example in particular shows how to use section templates, where meta
data from the section files can be included via the section template in a
non-trivial manner. See also how fields can be passed through a filter
before being displayed, eg the content of a markdown field :foo|md: can be
accessed as html in the template as `{foo}`.

Additionally a convenience file `index.html` is created that links to all
generated files, in the order in which they appeared on the command line.
