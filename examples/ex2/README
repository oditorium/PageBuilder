# Example 2 -- Converting multiple files into a single document

## Usage

- run `convert` to convert the files
- run `serve` to serve the current directory
- run `clean` to remove generated files

## Description

This is an example for converting files into a a single html file: when
running the `convert` command,  the all files in the directory are converted
into a single file called  `document.html` (as will as into individual
files).

Additionally a convenience file `index.html` is created that links to all
generated files, in the order in which they appeared on the command line.
