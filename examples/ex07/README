# Example 7 -- Template Defaults

## Usage

- run `convert` to convert the files
- run `serve` to serve the current directory
- run `clean` to remove generated files

## Description

This example shows how defaults can be defined in the template itself, or
in the local settings file. In case it is defined in both, the settings
file overrides the template defaults, and both are overridden by whatever
is defined in the file itself.
