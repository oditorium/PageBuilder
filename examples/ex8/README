# Example 8 -- Data

## Usage

- run `convert` to convert the files
- run `serve` to serve the current directory
- run `clean` to remove generated files

## Description

This example how the `_DATA.json` and `_DATA.yaml` files can be used to
process data from the files and re-inject it. The general strategy in this
case is to run the conversion twice:

    (1) run PageBuilder conversion
    (2) run data analysis script on PageBuilder output
    (3) run PageBuilder conversion again

I is very important that the conversion in (1) does not fall over if there
is not yet any data output. The best stratgy to achieve this is to provide
pre-sets for the data fields.
