# Example 8 -- Data

## Usage

- run `convert` to convert the files
- run `serve` to serve the current directory
- run `clean` to remove generated files

## Description

This example how the `_DATA.json` and `_DATA.yaml` files can be used to
process data from the files and re-inject it. The general strategy in this
case is to run the conversion twice:

    (1) run PageBuilder conversion
    (2) run data analysis script on PageBuilder output
    (3) run PageBuilder conversion again

Any fields read from _DATA must be defined have default values in the 
template, not only so that the first calculation does not fall over, but
also that they are picked up at all. ONLY PARAMETERS THAT HAVE DEFAULT
VALUES WILL BE READ FROM THE _DATA.


    :defaults:          aggr_data =>        DATA

    {aggr_data}
